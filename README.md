## Note App
# React and Flux
Hey there, thanks for checking out my app. I've been looking into React for the last 2 weeks as well as the flux pattern. Saw an article online on ways to practice and put my new found knowledge to use, so I went for the conventional note app. It served as a great challenge. Needless to say its not perfect, but it works. Didn't stay true to Flux the whole way through, but I can come back and update at any time.
